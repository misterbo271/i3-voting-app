2. **Voting Interface**: User sees 3 remaining teams and can vote for one
3. **Results Display**: After voting, user sees current results and cannot vote again

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and animations
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## Running the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Mobile Optimization

- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions
- Optimized viewport settings
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds

## Vote Persistence

The app uses localStorage to track:
- Which team the user belongs to
- Whether they have voted
- Which team they voted for
- Current vote counts

This ensures users cannot vote multiple times even if they:
- Refresh the page
- Close and reopen the browser
- Clear cookies (localStorage persists)

To reset voting data, users would need to manually clear localStorage or use developer tools.
